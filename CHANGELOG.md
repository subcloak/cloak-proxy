Full release notes, with links to the docs for each feature: https://docs.subcloak.com/cloak-proxy/reference/release-notes/

## 0.2.0 (October 2026)

### New
- **Rewrite**, the twelfth debugging tool: set, add or remove headers and query parameters, change the status, and find and replace in URLs and bodies, without code.
- **Rules for chosen apps**: any rule can be limited to the apps you list.
- **Repeat Advanced**: send a request up to 10,000 times, up to 100 at once, with status counts and timing (min, average, p95, max).
- **Break on Next Request**: a one-shot breakpoint for the next matching request.
- **Mute an app**: proxy it without recording its traffic.
- **Keep captured traffic when Cloak Proxy quits** (off by default).
- **Highlights and comments** are saved in session and HAR files.
- **Generate Types** from JSON in TypeScript, Swift, Python, Go and Kotlin.
- **New snippet formats**: k6 load test, Python httpx and Playwright API test.
- **cloakctl**: `flow`, `monitor`, `sdk` and `mcp-server` commands.
- **MCP server**: 86 tools, including `repeat_request_many`, `generate_types`, `break_on_next` and `mute_app`.

### Fixed
- The SOCKS5 port checks the allowed-devices list like the main port.
- Passwords are masked in settings returned by the control API and MCP.
- Workspace folders with a `.gitignore` get `.cloak/` added to it.
- wget snippets no longer turn off certificate checks.
- Scripting keeps repeated query parameters and headers.
- Request numbers continue after the proxy restarts.
- Clearing API client history stays cleared.
